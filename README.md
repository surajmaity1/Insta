Here, I have used Firebase Storage, Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Glide, and many more ğŸš€...

**ğŸ”¸1. Log In and Out With Firebase Auth:**

Firebase Auth provides authentication to our app so that we can include features like email authentication, backend services, and many more.

**ğŸ”¸2. Data Class:**

How to hold data for the User?
Data classes are used to hold data.

**ğŸ”¸3. RecyclerView and Adapter:**

Here, RecyclerView is used to show large sets of data efficiently. Also, the adapter is used to make a bridge between the data source and the UI.

**ğŸ”¸4. Cloud Firestore:**

Cloud Firestore helps to fetch and sync data according to our needs. As it is based on NoSQL, so it lets you store, query, and upload files easily.

**ğŸ”¸5. Glide:**
Glide is an Open Source Image Loader Library that is used to load images from Firebase with the help of a URL.
